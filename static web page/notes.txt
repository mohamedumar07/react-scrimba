React

rendering all our markup using react inside markup

root in react -> once place where react will insert everything

createRoot() -> will take a DOM node as an input where all the markups will be stuffed inside


When you might not want a framework:

	-> small project
	-> Network Load Concern
	-> Learning Curve
	-> Maintenance concerns
	-> Incompatibility with existing codebase


createElement() of react is somewhat similar to document.createElement()
 
createElement() returns a JS object which is understood by React.


JSX -> HTML inside JS, but stricter than HTML
    -> Has to be inside div tag or empty <> </> wrapper.

React takes the JSX code and uses the createElement.


React is composable
	-> Reusing the code, declaring a custom component and use it wherever needed.
	-> putting together small pieces to build something large.

Composability is achieved through components in react.


Can render a single JSX at a time, which can have as many children as we want.

React Component : Component which returns react element
React element -> JSX Syntax -> createElement -> JS Object -> react interprets them and turn into real DOM element

WorkAround For <div> in Component is to use Fragment In-Built component in React library.

<> </> -> under the hood react implements the fragment for us.
